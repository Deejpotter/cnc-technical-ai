# Maker Store AI

A chatbot which can provide detailed technical information about Maker Store products and machines.
It is built using Python and Flask, and deployed on Heroku.

## Note

This is a work in progress. This is for testing purposes only. It will almost certainly not work as intended and tell you incorrect information. Always double check with a Maker Store staff member.

## Getting Started

To get started, just clone this repository and run the following command:

```bash
flask run
```

It will require your own key for the openai api to be set in the .env
