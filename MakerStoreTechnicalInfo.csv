Question,Response
,"Hi [customer],
Sorry that I missed you a couple of times on the live chat.
I have the answer to your question. The DM556 Stepper Driver and the Nema 23 2.45N.m Stepper Motors are an excellent match for your E5XMCS Motion Controller.
The DM556 driver supports a voltage range of 20-50V and an output current of 1.4 to 5.6A, making it compatible with the Nema 23 motor's rated voltage of 3.6V and current of 3.0A. Additionally, the driver offers micro-step control and optoisolated signal terminals for better performance and reduced interference.

Here are the links to the products for your convenience:

,"Hi [customer],

Thanks for getting in contact earlier.

I have more information about the machines you could use for milling moulds.

It sounds like you want a large working height on the Z-Axis so you can cut tall items.
Our machine that has the largest Z-Axis cutting height is the Lead CNC.

We currently have a sale for Father's Day where we have some full kits reduced in price, including the most popular sizes and components that people choose for our machines.

We have kits that include a machine table and some that don't include a table.

1000mm Lead CNC
Our recommended kit for the Lead CNC is 1000x1000mm and that includes a table. You can find that machine at the following link:
https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/kit-lead-1010-rc-table/
The working area for this machine is:
730mm width x 810mm length x 238mm height (with a 12mm wasteboard).

This one has been reduced from $4,643.87 to $4,243.87.

,"Hi [customer],

Thanks for your patience while I created this quote for you.

I talked to the engineers, and they suggested these items are recommended to ensure the E5X works as well as possible:
Digital Stepper Driver – DM556
While the TB6600 will technically work with the E5X, it is recommended to replace the TB6600 with DM556 motor drivers to ensure the smooth operation of the controller.
Your LRS-350-24 power supply will be sufficient to power your stepper motors but the engineers recommended upgrading to the Power Supply – 36V 450W if you're upgrading to the DM556 Stepper Drivers as they require more power.
Dual Output Power Supply 5V and 24V
This Dual Output power supply will be required to power up the E5X MCS controller. (The E5X controller requires both 5V and 24V power outputs)
To be clear, the Dual Output Power Supply 5V and 24V – 65W – RD-65B will be required for the E5X to work and the upgraded Stepper Drivers and Power Supply are recommended by the engineers for best performance, but not technically required.

I've created 2 quotes for you:
The first one is for just the E5X and Dual Power Supply which is required for the controller to work.
This is Order #[order number].
You can find the payment link for this one below:
[payment link]
The second one is for all the items that are recommended by the engineers for use with the E5X.
This is Order #[order number].

"Hi, I have a second hand Workbee from your store, not sure if it's v1 or v2.2. I also got both and air and water spindle. I was looking at mounting the second spindle on a slave z axis to enable cutting 2 of the same item at once, halving the cutting time. I was wondering if my machine would be compatible with your rack and pinion system on the x axis, and the pros & cons of your rack and pinion vs lead screw. Thanks!","Hi [customer],

Thanks for contacting us, sorry we missed you.

It's possible that your machine is compatible with our rack and pinion system as well as a slave Z axis but we need to get some more information to provide the most accurate assistance
Could you please let me know what controller you're using as well as what kind of spindles and motors you have?

I can provide the information I have so far.
First, no matter what components you have you will need 2 VFDs, 1 for each spindle.
You will also need a second set of Z-Axis components for the slave axis.
The engineers also said you would probably be looking at upgrading your controller to one that can handle duplicating the Z-Axis, but again we need more information about your current components to say for sure.

In regards to your question about the lead screw vs the rack and pinion system:
The lead screw transmission will generally be slightly more accurate but move slower.
The rack and pinion transmission is generally suggested if you want to extend the axis further than 1500mm as it allows accuracy at longer distances but it doesn't provide as high precision as a lead screw.

Please let me know some more information about your components so I can provide further assistance.

If you have any other questions, please let me know and I would be happy to help.

"Hi [Staff Member],
Thank you for the reply.
Sorry I forgot to specify that I was only asking about the mechanical side, I'm an industrial sparky, so I've got the electronics covered. I'm currently running a BTT SKR v1.3 with GRBLHAL, but depending on the final design I may change this.

What is the travel distance per rotation of the lead screw vs rack and pinion?

I failed to specify that the interest in the rack and pinion is to be able to adjust the spacing between the two heads depending on the product being machined.

Would the plates that currently have the x-axis nut blocks be the same as those used to mount the stepper motor for rack and pinion? I'm just unsure if the design has changed since this one was made.

Thanks!

Thanks,
[customer]","Hi [customer],

Thanks for getting back to me and for clarifying what you're looking for.

I have a table here that you can use to compare the travel distance for the lead screw vs rack and pinion:
image.png
You can see the base travel distance listed under mm/rev.
The actual travel distance will depend on the Micro Step setting on your stepper driver. You can see the step distance listed under the mm/step columns. 
You can find the relevant Micro Step settings at the top of that table.

Regarding your question about the X-Axis plates, it looks like the design of the plates changed between V2.2 and V3 so the plates will be different.
Also, the motor for a rack and pinion system needs to be mounted perpendicular to the X-Axis using a Gear Rack Motor Mount Plate which looks like this:
image.png
That's opposed to the Lead Screw system which has the motor mounted parallel to the X-Axis at the end of the axis.

I hope I have answered your questions well.

"Hi [Staff Member],
That's all extremely helpful, thank you so much!

That chart and drawing make it really easy to understand.

Is it possible to use any of the gear sizes specified in the table? I assume they have different diameters, is the mounting plate moved to suit this?

Thanks again for your help!
[customer]","Hi [customer],

Thanks for your reply.

I just got more information from the engineers and they said you will have to upgrade your whole X-Axis to be compatible with the Rack and Pinion transmission as there are some other parts that are different as well.
If you want to see the items you will need, you can see them on our website at the following links:
WorkBee V3 X-Axis Front Plate

Module 1.0 Pinion Gear – 6.35mm Bore
https://www.makerstore.com.au/product/gear-m1/
In terms of the gear sizes, I can't say for sure exactly which sizes you could use.

The recommended size for the WorkBee Rack and Pinion system is the 16-tooth Pinion Gear which comes in our kit.

It's possible that other sizes would work but that would take some experimentation.
As I mentioned in my previous email, it's possible to change the travel distance per step using the micro-step settings on the stepper driver.

I just talked to one of your staff on the phone about mounting the X axis stepper motor on the left side, rather than the right on my Outback 1500x1000 CNC kit.

If you could forward me the relevant software information that would be great!

Cheers,

-[customer]","Hi [customer],

Thanks for getting in contact with us.

I looked into this and there shouldn't be any issues with moving the motor to the opposite side other than having to invert the X-Axis in the software settings.

If you're using ioSender (which is recommended for the OutBack machine) you can invert the homing and stepping direction by editing your GRBL settings.
Look for the Homing Direction and Stepper Direction settings or something similar.
You want to invert only the X-Axis for each.
If you want more information you can look at our manual here:

"Hi [Staff Member],

Looking at the picture below- will the beams be cut by hand with a hacksaw or a mill? 

I’m building a CNC machine so tolerances will have to be good in order for the system to work properly, do you know what tolerances the beam will be cut too?
[customer]

","Hi [customer],

Thank you for getting back to me so quickly,

The picture above is just to explain to our customers about the cutting blade kerf. I apologize if it is misleading.

We use an Industrial Saw with an inbuilt DRO system to cut our Aluminium extrusion precisely as per our customer's requirements.

Our Industrial Saw has a cutting tolerance of 0.5mm.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.

"Hey guys,

Just spoke to you guys on the phone, regarding a probing issue, where we consistently get ALARM 4, when we press start. Attached below is our wiring. Hoping its a simple fix any ideas?

Kind regards","Hi [customer]

Thanks for sending through the photos and the video.

Your touch probe wiring to the controller looks fine, the issue can be in the probe option of ioSender. Can you please ensure the ""invert probe pin"" option in the Settings: Grbl window is ticked on. 

Please check the image below to find the invert probe option:
Click on Settings: Grbl > Probing > Invert probe pin: true > invert probe pin

The wobbling of the lead screw indicates it has not been tightened properly using the Lead Screw Tensioning Nut. Please ensure the lock collars on all the axes are tightened properly.
